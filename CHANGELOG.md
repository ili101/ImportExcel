# 5.4.X - 2018-12-27
## What's new
* `Export-Excel` [DataTable] support and improved performance. To use the acceleration you need to provide the DataTable to Export-Excel.
When you pipe the DataTable to Export-Excel PowerShell "unrolls" it passing the individual DataRows one by one.
To prevent this you can use the -TargetData switch explicitly `Export-Excel -TargetData $DataTable` or pipe with ", " before your variable `, $DataTable | Export-Excel`. This also prevent the creation of the extra [DataRows] columns "RowError", "RowState", "Table", "ItemArray", "HasErrors".

* `Export-Excel` Added Parameter `-Table [Switch]`, To enable creating a Table without setting -TableName. The table name will be "Table[N]" or with name from the [DataTable] if exists. Table can be created by passing -TableName and/or -TableStyle and/or -Table.

* `Export-Excel` Added Parameter `-AutoSizeFirst [Int]`, Itâ€™s the same as -AutoSize but let you limit the number of checked lines to improve performance.

* `Export-Excel -New` now supports -TableName, -TableStyle and -Table.
